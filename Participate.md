We encourage both **experienced community members and newcomers** to share their **insights**, **best practices**, **anecdotes**, **examples** and **concrete experiences**, while others provide **questions**, **problems**, **use cases** and **experiences** in this area.

We offer various forms to participate in the workshop:

- **Glorious failures:**
  Short or extended papers, up to 6 and 12 pages respectively (Evaluation) papers that include:
  1. description of used datasets;
  2. research questions and hypotheses;
  3. applied evaluation protocol, benchmarks or gold standards; and
  4. the practiced statistical methods for result analysis.
  Authors are encouraged to explain the properties of the approach that support the observed negative results, and show that the results prove that the hypotheses are not true.
  *The focus is on methodology, rather than on problematic implementations.*

- **Confessions:** 
  Extended abstracts or positions, up to 2 pages that describe **testimonies**, **short stories**, **experiences** in a more informal fashion or **technical/development** issues that prevent the progress of the Semantic Webâ€™s research.

- **Abstracts** with questions, proposals or discussion topics relevant to the workshop, to be discussed during.

All submissions need to explicitly discuss their relevance to the field. A focus on contributions to related works is desired.
