We encourage both **experienced community members and newcomers** to share their **insights**, **best practices**, **anecdotes**, **examples** and **concrete experiences**, while others provide **questions**, **problems**, **use cases** and **experiences** in this area.

We offer various forms to participate in the workshop:

- **Glorious failures**

  Short or extended papers, up to six and twelve pages, respectively. These evaluation papers should include:
  1. description of used datasets;
  2. research questions and hypotheses;
  3. applied evaluation protocol, benchmarks or gold standards; and
  4. statistical methods used for analyzing the observed results.
  Authors are encouraged to explain the properties of the approach that support the results that falsify their hypotheses.
  *The focus is on methodology, rather than on problematic implementations.*

- **Confessions**

  Extended abstracts, up to two pages. Confessions describe **testimonies**, **short stories**, and **experiences** in a more informal fashion or **technical/development** issues that prevent the progress of the Semantic Webâ€™s research.

- **Position Papers**

  Extended abstracts, up to two pages.
  Short essays describing your position on issues related to the workshop's topic. 

- **Abstracts** 

  A short, but otherwise free submission format that could include questions, proposals or or any other discussion topic relevant to be discussed during the workshop.

All submissions need to explicitly discuss their relevance to the field. A focus on contributions to related works is desired.
