Goals
=================
Scientific research has a strong publication bias towards works with positive results, in the Semantic Web field this is not different. However, negative or inconclusive results are fundamental to the research process and can be just as valuable as positive results.

This workshop provides a forum for such attempted approaches, methodologies, or implementations, while aiming at
**breaking the taboo of negative results** in Semantic Web and Linked Data research
incentivising researchers to **share tests, applied methodologies or documented approaches that did not reach their goal**, so they can be studied, and learned from
obtaining knowledge on when and how negative or inconclusive should be published (e.g., best practices)

Motivation
==================
Nowadays, there is a strong positive publication bias: approaches reporting exciting positive, and thus significant, results are more likely to be published at conferences and journals.
Statistically significant outcome, e.g., from benchmarking, have higher chances of being fully reported, discarding knowledge about what is proven false or not working.
However, such testimonies are fundamental in scientific research and occur more frequently than positive results.

Many efforts are put on examining alternative solutions that not always end up better than existing solutions on all or certain aspects. Unfortunately, those cases are never publicly documented, causing other researchers to repeat them over and over again. This creates a huge overhead in our communityâ€™s progress.

**Well documented negative or inconclusive results** might

 - **reveal fundamental flaws and obstacles** in commonly used methods,
 - act as catalyst for **formalising empirical knowledge** and
 - **gain insights** that contribute to the progress of Semantic Web technology.

However, **publishing such negative results currently lacks incentives**, as authors never get attributed or cited.

This workshop addresses the way Semantic Web research deals with the insufficient evidence of negative results, following the trend, as other disciplines do, to this **fight against negative publication bias**. The uppermost goal is to turn intuitive knowledge on semantic technologies into justifiable arguments and gain formal proofs of non-optimal solutions.
