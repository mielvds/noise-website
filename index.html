    Every Semantic Web researcher has been there; you spend days of work, but the results just donâ€™t give the answer you were hoping for. The work ends up, like so many, part of the File Drawer Effect: they never get reported because of negative or inconclusive outcome. This occurs as a result of a publication bias towards positive results in Semantic Web. However, negative or inconclusive results are fundamental to the research process and can be just as valuable. This workshop provides a forum for such attempted approaches, methodologies, or implementations. Researchers are urged to report null, disappointing or inconclusive attempts in the Semantic Web and Linked Open Data research field.
