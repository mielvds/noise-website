This workshop specifically targets sound works, thus scientifically or technically relevant contributions, with negative or inconclusive results after an evaluation. We welcome submissions in, but not limited to, the following categories:
Applied research methodology in the context of Semantic Web and Linked Data that produces unexpected, inconclusive, provocative or negative results
Mismatches between theoretical designs (or properties) and experimental results
theoretical sound approaches that fail in implementation
approaches with wrong assumptions regarding Semantic Web technology
Generality limitations of solutions that help to advance the state of the art.
solutions that only outperform the state-of the-art in a very specific context
papers that verify or refute results published in the past
verified hypotheses from other areas (e.g., Databases, AI) that cannot be verified or equally good replicated using Semantic Web technologies
Novel groundbreaking ideas related to Semantic Web technologies whose implementation risks can not be estimated.
